\title{plot cluster-cluster or segment-segment overlaps}
\usage{
plotOverlaps(x, p.min = 0.01, p.txt = p.min * 5, n = 100, short = TRUE,
  scale = 1, round, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a `clusterOverlaps' object returned by
\code{\link{clusterCluster}}}

\item{p.min}{significance cutoff, p-values equal or smaller to
this cutoff will appear black; TODO: plot legend}

\item{p.txt}{p-value cutoff for showing overlap numbers as white instead
of black text}

\item{n}{number of gray shades between \code{p=1} (white)
and \code{p >= p.min} (black)}

\item{short}{logical, indicating whether to cut higher overlap
numbers; currently: division by 1000 and replacement by \code{k}}

\item{scale}{factor to divide overlap numbers with, useful for
low numbers in Jaccard index}

\item{round}{number of digits to round overlap numbers to (useful
for Jaccard index)}

\item{...}{arguments to \code{\link{image_matrix}}}
}
\description{
Plots the significance distribution of cluster-cluster or segment-segment
overlap statistics provided by \code{\link{clusterCluster}} or
\code{\link{segmentJaccard}}, where the a white-black gradient is
calculated from \code{-log(p)}, and the text shows the overlap statistics,
i.e., the number of overlapping features for \code{\link{clusterCluster}},
or the Jaccard index for \code{\link{segmentJaccard}}. Note that two
distinct p-value cutoffs can be visualyized: p-values \code{<=p.min}
are shown in black, and p-values \code{p.txt} are shown in white instead
of black text (thus becoming visible on the black of significant
overlaps).
