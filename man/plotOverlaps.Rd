\title{plot cluster-cluster overlaps}
\usage{
plotOverlaps(x, p.min = 0.01, p.txt = p.min * 5, n = 100, short = TRUE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a `clusterOverlaps' object returned by
\code{\link{clusterCluster}}}

\item{p.min}{significance cutoff, p-values equal or smaller to
this cutoff will appear black; TODO: plot legend}

\item{p.txt}{p-value cutoff for showing white text}

\item{n}{number of gray shades between \code{p=1} (white)
and \code{p >= p.min} (black)}

\item{short}{logical, indicating whether to cut higher overlap
numbers; currently: division by 1000 and replacement by \code{k}}

\item{...}{arguments to \code{\link{image_matrix}}}
}
\description{
Plots the significance distribution of a cluster-cluster
overlap statistics provided by \code{\link{clusterCluster}},
where the a white-black gradient is calculated from \code{-log(p)}.
