\title{calculate peak phase}
\usage{
calculatePhase(x, cycles, degrees = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a time-series matrix with columns as time points,
or a \code{timeseries} object as returned by
\code{\link[segmenTier]{processTimeseries}}}

\item{cycles}{optional integer vector for the DFT components
(number of cycles in the data) for which phases are to be calculated;
all are returned if \code{cycle} is not specified}

\item{degrees}{logical to indicate whether phases should be reported
in degrees (0 - 360) or radians (0 - 2*pi)}
}
\description{
calculate phases via a Discrete Fourier Transformation, but starting
at the first time point, such that phase 0/360 indicates peak
at time 0, and phase 180 indicates peak at half of the cycle
}
